As loadshedding continues to worsen, South Africans are looking for ways to shield themselves and their businesses from the worst effects of this electricity crisis. This has resulted in a widespread movement to install residential solar panels across South Africa. The DA-led City of Cape Town has already announced innovative plans to encourage the adoption of solar panels in the City. In a groundbreaking move, the City has proactively sought and been granted an exemption from National Treasury from ordinary procurement rules, that will allow it to pay businesses and residents cash for selling their excess electricity back into the grid. The City has also announced that it will be paying an additional incentive tariff on top of the NERSA approved feed-in tariff so as to further encourage the feeding of electricity back into the grid. Proposals like these will encourage households to increasingly reduce their reliance on the grid, thereby helping to alleviate loadshedding in the City. The DA now wishes to bring these solutions, and more, to all South Africans through our proposed Solar Access Bill – now under active development. The proposed aims of the Bill include the following: These proposed aims of the Bill will immediately unlock the potential of the private sector and help contribute towards alleviating the electricity shortage on South Africa’s grid. The DA requests comments and suggestions from the public on the proposed aims of the Bill at legislation@da.org.za by 31 March 2023. Further details on the Solar Access Bill will be announced in due course.
