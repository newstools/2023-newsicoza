(JNS) A Palestinian terrorist shot an Israeli father and son near the entrance to the City of David National Park adjacent to Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday morning, a day after a deadly shooting rampage at a synagogue elsewhere in the Israeli capital. Police said the attacker, a 13-year-old from the nearby Silwan/Shiloach neighborhood, was shot and neutralized by armed civilians. The Kan public broadcaster identified the terrorist as Muhammad Aliyat. The Magen David Adom emergency medical service said the victims were treated at the scene for gunshot wounds to the upper body and then taken to the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in serious but stable condition. The father’s condition subsequently improved to moderate. The terrorist was also taken to the hospital. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi on Friday night ordered the reinforcement of troops in Judea and Samaria in preparation for a possible military escalation in the wake of the attack at the synagogue that killed seven people. Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai similarly ordered the alert level raised to the highest level in the capital after the shooting attack at a Jewish house of worship in the Neve Ya’akov neighborhood. The moves were announced after a security assessment led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited the scene of the attack. “Our hearts go out to the families of the wounded and dead. We have assessed the situation and decided on some immediate actions. We will act decisively,” said Netanyahu.
